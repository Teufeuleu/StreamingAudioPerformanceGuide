# A guide to live stream musical performances from home

This guide is intended for people wanting to live stream a musical performance from home. It provides informations for most kind of setups, from purely acoustic performances to more complex cases implying a DAW, an external sound card with connected instruments and mics.

It focuses mainly on audio configuration as it might be the most tricky part depending on your setup, although it also includes walkthroughs for all the steps from installing a streaming software to actually start streaming.

## Prerequisites

- Knowing what you want to play and the involved equipment
- A computer running **Windows** or **macOS**[^1]
- A bit of free time to read this guide carefully

We will use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) as our streaming software but you are not required to know how to use it.

## Why I wrote this guide?
It began during the COVID-19 lockdown. During this period we saw many initiatives (online festivals, groups, personal projects) aiming to live stream artists and musicians performing from their home.
I got somehow involved in some of these projects and saw the lack of information regarding the audio configuration, which can differ A LOT depending on the musical project itself. So I tried to find a solution for most cases and sorting everything properly allowing people to find which case fit their needs and how to do it.
