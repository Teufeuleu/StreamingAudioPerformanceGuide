# 3. Which audio setup do I use?

First you need to determine the kind of audio setup you are using:

- [My performance is purely acoustic and/or I just need one mic to capture it](dawless.md)
- [My performance requires an audio software but no external sound card](daw.md)
- [My performance requires an audio software and an external sound card](dawinterface.md)

This will lead you to the [appropriate instructions](../audio/README.md) to prepare the audio part of your live stream.
