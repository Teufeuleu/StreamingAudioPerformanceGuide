#My performance is purely acoustic and/or I just need one mic to capture it

If you don't necessary need a computer for your performance, you might consider streaming from a smartphone as it is very simple to set up. Just download the app corresponding to your streaming platform, do what they tell you to do and you should be good.
If you need to stream to a custom RTMP server, you can use Larix Broadcaster because it's free, simple to use, and available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/larix-broadcaster/id1042474385) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wmspanel.larix_broadcaster&hl=en). If you don't have a proper microphone, many phones these days still have a decent quality, sometime even in stereo, so why not!

You may prefer to use a computer if you don't have a smartphone, or if you use a webcam with it's built-in mic, a USB microphone, a mini-jack microphone or an XLR microphone you nee to plug into your external audio interface. We assume here that you do not need a DAW. Choose the case corresponding to your situation:

-   If you use the **built-in mic of your computer** or your **webcam**, the
    **build-in mic input** of your computer or an **USB microphone**, refer
    to [Case 1: OBS + Mic/Aux source](../audio/micaux.md).

-   If you have to **plug your microphone into your external audio interface**:

    -   **macOS user**: refer to [Case 1: OBS + Mic/Aux source](../audio/micaux.md).

    -   **Windows user**:
        -   External sound card with **MME/DirectX drivers**: [Case 2: OBS + Desktop Audio Source](../audio/desktopaudio.md)
        -   External sound card with **ASIO drivers**: [Case 4: OBS + OBS-ASIO (Windows only)](../audio/obsasio.md)
